<h2>Abstract</h2><p>Electronic Data Capture (EDC) solutions are progressively being adopted in clinical trials and studies, carried out by biomedical, pharmaceutical and health-care research teams. This document presents the MedRed Ontology, whose goal is to represent the metadata of the instruments that constitute these studies, using well-established standards, and reusing related vocabularies to describe validation rules, composability, and provenance. Furthermore, the ontology was validated with existing clinical studies in the context of the MedRed project for data acquisition, as well as a collection of publicly available metadata of well-known studies.</p>
