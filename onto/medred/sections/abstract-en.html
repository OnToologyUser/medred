<h2>Abstract</h2><p>Electronic Data Capture (EDC) software solutions are progressively being adopted for conducting clinical trials and studies, carried out by biomedical, pharmaceutical and health-care research teams. In this document we present the MedRed Ontology, whose goal is to represent the metadata of the instruments that constitute these studies, using well-established standards, and reusing related vocabularies to describe essential aspects, such as validation rules, composability, or provenance. This document describes the design principles behind the ontology and how it relates to existing models and formats used in the industry. It also presents every class and property defined in the ontology, including examples of use. MedRed reuses well-known vocabularies and recommendations of W3C, including PROV-O, and SHACL. Furthermore, the ontology has been validated with existing clinical studies in the context of the MedRed project for data acquisition, as well as a collection of publicly available metadata of well-known studies. The ontology has been made available publicly following best practices and vocabulary sharing guidelines, under the URI: <a href="http://w3id.org/medred/medred#">http://w3id.org/medred/medred#</a>.</p>
