cshq_date_b,childs_sleep_habits_questionnaire_cshq,"Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (Preschool and School-Aged) BEDTIME<br><br>The following statements are about your child's sleep habits and possible difficulties with sleep. Think about the past week in your life when you answer the questions. If last week was unusual for a specific reason (such as your child had an ear infection and did not sleep well or the TV set was broken), choose the most recent typical week. Answer USUALLY if something occurs 5 or 6 times a week; answer SOMETIMES if it occurs 2 to 4 times a week; answer RARELY if something occurs never or 1 time during a week. Also, please indicate whether or not the sleep habit is a problem by choosing ""Yes"", ""No"", or ""Not applicable (N/A).",text,"Date of CSHQ",,,date_ymd,,,,,,,,,,
